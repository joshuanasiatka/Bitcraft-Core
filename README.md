# Bitcraft Core (BCC): *The Core Development Framework for the Bitcraft Module Library*

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Bitcraft Core** is the backend system that allows for the implementation of our library modules. We aren't fans of the MVC systems that are available to date and we didn't see an easy way to implement what it is that we want to do, therefore we though *"Why not write our own?"* and here we are.

Any questions regarding this project, contact [support@bitcraftlabs.net](mailto:support@bitcraftlabs.net) with the keyword *Bitcraft Core* in the subject line.

*Any issues with the code can be directed [here](https://github.com/joshuanasiatka/Bitcraft-Core/issues).*

> **NOTE:** Please see the BCC-Structure branch for the latest code. The master branch has been abandoned and will eventually be replaced by the first working version of Bitcraft Core.
